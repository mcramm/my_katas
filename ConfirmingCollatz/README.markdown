### Confirm Collatz Kata ###
### Silly idea from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture
* * *
This kata was written to show/confirm the Collatz Conjecture.

The conjecture basically goes as such:

 1. Take any natural number (n)
 2. If n is even, divide it by 2 (n/2)
 3. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add one  (3n + 1)
 4. Repeat 2-3 until n == 1

The conjecture states that this will work using any number. This kata was written to simply take an input, run the 
operations, and count how many steps it took to get to 1 (if it gets there at all!)
